pblat-cluster - parallelized blat (cluster version)
blat with cluster parallel hybrid computing support

When the query file format is fasta, you can specify many processes in a cluster
to process it. Processes running in the same node use shared memory. Thus pblat-cluster
works in hybrid computing mode. This will minimize the memory usage per node. It can
reduce run time linearly. This program is useful when you blat a big query file to a
huge reference like human whole genome sequence.

The program is based on the original blat program which was written by Jim Kent.

pblat-cluster can run on Linux clusters with MPI support.

    Install
################
To compile the source code, simply enter the source code directory in terminal
and issue the "make" command. When the compiling finished, the executable
pblat-cluster will locate in the same directory. Then it can be moved to where
you want.


################
     Run
################
Two ways to run pblat-cluster in a cluster:

1) without PBS
mpirun -n <N> pblat-cluster database query output.psl

2) with PBS
You can write a bash script and submit to PBS using qsub/sbatch.

*** qsub script example ***
=================================================================
#!/bin/bash
#PBS -N pblat
#PBS -l nodes=32:ppn=4

cd workingdir

mpirun pblat-cluster genome.fa reads.fa out.psl
=================================================================


*** sbatch script example ***
=================================================================
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -J pblat
#SBATCH -N 32
#SBATCH -n 4

cd workingdir

mpirun pblat-cluster genome.fa reads.fa out.psl
=================================================================
