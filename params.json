{"name":"pblat-cluster","tagline":"blat with cluster parallel hybrid computing support","body":"## Welcome to pblat-cluster\r\nWhen the query file format is fasta, you can specify many processes in a cluster\r\nto process it. Processes running in the same node use shared memory. Thus pblat-cluster\r\nworks in hybrid computing mode. This will minimize the memory usage per node. It can\r\nreduce run time linearly. This program is useful when you blat a big query file to a\r\nhuge reference like human whole genome sequence.\r\n\r\nThe program is based on the original blat program which was written by Jim Kent.\r\n\r\npblat-cluster can run on **Linux clusters** with **MPI** support.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\nTo compile the source code, simply enter the source code directory in terminal\r\nand issue the \"make\" command. When the compiling finished, the executable\r\npblat-cluster will locate in the same directory. Then it can be moved to where\r\nyou want.\r\n```\r\n$ make\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Run\r\nTwo ways to run pblat-cluster in a cluster:\r\n\r\n### without PBS\r\n```\r\n$ mpirun -n <N> pblat-cluster database query output.psl\r\n```\r\n\r\n### with PBS\r\nYou can write a bash script and submit to PBS using qsub/sbatch.\r\n\r\n* qsub script example\r\n```batch\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n#PBS -N pblat\r\n#PBS -l nodes=32:ppn=4\r\n\r\ncd workingdir\r\n\r\nmpirun pblat-cluster genome.fa reads.fa out.psl\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n* sbatch script example\r\n```batch\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n#SBATCH -J pblat\r\n#SBATCH -N 32\r\n#SBATCH -n 4\r\n\r\ncd workingdir\r\n\r\nmpirun pblat-cluster genome.fa reads.fa out.psl\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\npblat is modified from blat, the licence is the same as blat.
